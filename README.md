# About this project

This project shows you some  WSA APIs
  Written in Python language, completely using WSAclient.exe (without ADB), demonstrating some related usage of "WSAclient.exe"
  You can use these methods to control the WSA with the terminal
  When the wsaclient.exe is called, the WSA will be automatically started, so there is no need to keep the WSA in the powered on state

# About the wsaclient.exe

This file is installed in a system-callable directory (%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\) when WSA is installed

# :warning: Note

None of the APIs used by this project are publicly available and the availability of these APIs cannot be guaranteed at this time
  The latest version of WSA (version: 2210.40000.7.0) is available

# API source

The wsaclient API used by this project refers to the following literature:

# Some other stuff

WSAclient doesn't seem to provide a way to install an APK, so if you want to install an APK, you'll still need to use ADB
